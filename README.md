# Shopee Home Business Product
Home business is a business whose primary office is within their home regardless of the size of the office as long as it is located at home. Various home businesses can be done such as bakery business, crafty ideas, online retail, soap making, skin care &amp; beauty, and many more. This project aims to collect and share information on the findings of several products sold as home business through the Shopee application platform in Malaysia. The obtained data is then stored in the form of sql and csv file format so it can be used by individuals in need for their own research needs.
